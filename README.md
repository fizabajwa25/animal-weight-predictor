# Animal Weight Predictor

This project uses a simple machine learning model (linear regression) to predict the weight of an animal based on its height and length. It generates synthetic data for six different animals: Cat, Dog, Panda, Giraffe, Gorilla, and Zebra.

---

## Project Features

- Creates a random dataset of animal body measurements
- Trains a linear regression model using scikit-learn
- Predicts the weight of a new animal using height and length
- Visualizes body size vs weight using a scatter plot
